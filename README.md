# Com-FI

Part 2 of the project to the class of Web Development.
---

## Purpose of the project
demonstrate knowledge on:
- creating web apps using react
- consuming APIs

### API - Asp.Net
We chose Asp.Net as the server side framework because the Part 1 of this project was in Asp.Net. I regret the choice. Laravel would make a better choice for a small project like this one.

Stack:
```
Asp.net - server side (API)
React
React-router
Tailwindcss (styling)
Sweetalert2 (alert components)
(probably some more i don't remember)
```

### What was missing?
* Dealing with images (server-side)
* No authentication

```
final classification: 17.1/20
